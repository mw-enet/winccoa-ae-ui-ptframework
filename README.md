# WinCC OA Panel Topology Framework
**Gives your SCADA project a structured face. This will modernize its look and feel, taking the visual design and user experience to the next level through smart navigation, faceplate mechanisms, Alarm monitoring, and intuitive screen layouts.**

## Abstract 
**The WinCC OA Panel Topology Framework** is your entry point to building clean, navigable, and operator-friendly SCADA interfaces. Its modularity and visual consistency make it ideal for fast engineering, efficient maintenance, and scalable use. 

## Overview 

The WinCC OA Panel Topology Framework provides a ready-to-use structure for integrating WinCC OA project's panels. With its modular design, the framework provides you with: 

- A smart navigation mechanism 

- A smart faceplate mechanism 

- Alarm Monitoring 

- Easy panel integration 

This clean integration of SCADA functions enhances maintainability and speeds up project development. 

**Version:** WinCC OA 3.20

**Application Name:** WinCC OA Panel Topology Framework

## Key Features
## Modular Topology Structure
SCADA projects can be built using this modular and scalable framework. The **Panel Topology Framework** offers predefined sections that promote consistency, maintainability, and engineering efficiency.

The framework consists of five main parts: 

   1. **Modern Navigation Bar**
      
      Provides an easy and smooth structured and centralized navigation mechanism across all the project's panels.

   3. **Main Panel Area**

      Displays the panels content dynamically based on navigation or user actions.

   4. **Info and Alarming Panel**

      Integrates the system information and a dedicated alarm row for effective monitoring and controlling of the system alarms.

   5. **Available in WinCC OA Topology Templates** 

      The panel topology framework can be selected directly from the Panel Topology panel, like standard topology templates.
