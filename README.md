# Integration and Usage of the WinCC OA Panel Topology Framework

## Introduction: 

The WinCC OA Panel Topology Framework provides a structured and efficient approach to managing panel configurations within WinCC OA projects. This framework simplifies the integration of topology-based visualizations and enables seamless navigation and control over the entire system. 

The framework includes a smart and pre-configured faceplate mechanism and visualization elements designed for rapid deployment, ensuring consistency and ease of use in WinCC OA environments. It supports various project structures, making it adaptable for different applications. 

This example was created to be used with WinCC OA 3.20 

## Concept and Application: 
The WinCC OA Panel Topology Framework is designed to facilitate the integration of standardized topology views into WinCC OA projects. By using this framework, operators can achieve: 
- Smart Navigation & Structured Panel Layout: Enables seamless interaction and easy navigation between system components.

  Note: All values in Dashboard panel in “Fig. 01” are static (not changing), as there was no simulation or driver connectivity implemented in this example. 

- Predefined smart faceplate mechanism: Enhances usability and enables intuitive interaction with system elements
